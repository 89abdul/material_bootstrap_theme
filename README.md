# Material design for Bootstrap 3
This theme is a skin for Bootstrap, which means that can be used with any site built with the Bootstrap framework 3. With easy installation and customization thanks to the LESS/SASS files included and the custom themes colors ready to use. 
This skin is based on a material design and also extends the styles directly applied to Bootstrap files. Thereâ€™s no overwritten rules or bloating CSS, making a lightweight skin as Boostrap is itself.
